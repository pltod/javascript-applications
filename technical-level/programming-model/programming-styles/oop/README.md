There is a little change in terminology

> factories are actually constructor functions

> models are objects that are used as prototypes

> data holder objects are instances created with constructor functions, Object.create, or object literal. Depending on the way we create our data holders they have different values for their .constructor and internal [[Prototype]] properties
