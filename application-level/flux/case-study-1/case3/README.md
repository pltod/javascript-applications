#### How to Run It

* npm i to install everything

* npm run build to build the app

* npm start

* open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to try the app


#### Notes

* Build with webpack and npm combined

* It is using https://github.com/yahoo/express-state

> Share configuration and state data of an Express app with the client-side via JavaScript.

> Initial idea taken from https://github.com/expressjs/express-expose


* Again as with the others. We do not need template folders.

> Everything must be component - html, css, js
