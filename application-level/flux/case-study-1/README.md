# Project History

This is made in July/August 2014. At this time:

> Original Flux impl by Facebook was not open sourced yet

> Yahoo's take on the topic was still missing

> Popular flux impls like reflux were still missing

* See this amazing post for flux impls comparison at the end of 2014

> https://reactjsnews.com/the-state-of-flux/




# Project Info

* Investigating flux implementations based on some existing examples

* This was made before the appearance of the official facebook implementation https://github.com/facebook/flux

* Currently chat application is considered for more appropriate application for testing flux architecture. However the comparisons here are based on TODO MVC and other examples

* This is made in July/August 2014. The original source code of the examples used may be different now. Anyway this is not important because the original source code is reogranized to fit the same folder structure for easier comparison. The folders are as follows:

> app/client - the client code

> app/server - the server code

> app/shared - the shared code used on the client and the server

> static - where the artifacts produced by the build process are placed
