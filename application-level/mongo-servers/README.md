Very basic mongodb integration with the following app servers:

* express

* koa

* hapi


In each corresponding folder do:

* ```npm i```

* start mongo db on port 27017 (or if want another change config.json in root folder to correspond to it)

* ```npm start```

* open the browser on localhost:8000/db then see the console for having the db object printed out
