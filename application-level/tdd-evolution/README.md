# History 

* TDD is a nice approach to try out different JavaScript concepts

> For more see http://tddjs.com/

* The repos here evolved over the time in searching the best way to practice TDD with JS

> Initially jstestdriver was the only way to go

> Then Mocha was very well positioned to do nice testing

> Final step was done with Karma

* Currently the simplest way for me of doing testing for node and the browser is with tape
