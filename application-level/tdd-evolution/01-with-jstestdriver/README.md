**STATE**

> DEPRECATED


**PURPOSE**

> Test driven approach of experimenting with

> * the JavaScript language itself
> * frameworks and libraries
> * different architectural patterns


> Experimenting with js-test-driver test runner (http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/)


This project is created after first seeing the idea of TDD learning inside

> "Test-Driven JavaScript Development" book http://tddjs.com/



**HOW TO RUN IT**

The tests inside this project could be runned inside Eclipse that have js-test-driver plugin


**FOLLOW UP**


After this project I have tried something new inside https://github.com/pltod/javascript-playbook


It is still a way of TDD experiments but based on node.js, express, mocha, architect, and AMD modules.
