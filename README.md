# How it Works


* Run a test suite to learn a topic.

**See package.json for available suites**


> For example when running ```npm run test-modules``` you see this:

* Additionaly for some topics we have self contained subprojects that require running a db or running a server to try different concepts. For these see appropriate README files in the subfolders.


# Scaffolding

The major classification is as follows


**TECHNICAL LEVEL**

* learn about JavaScript programming model 

* learn about Asynchrony programming model

* learn about Execution environment model - JavaScript engines like V8


**APPLICATION LEVEL**

* learn about how to use modules, databases, application servers, frameworks, utility belts etc. - any application aspect you can think of
